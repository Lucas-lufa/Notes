## Disruptive Technology Case Study Part 1

ShadyTree Consulting has been contracted by the Office of the Minister for Education to determine what stance should be taken by using this technology in primary, secondary and tertiary schools in Australia. Your team is to create a report that will be submitted outlining a stance with a decision making framework using evidence and data support your claims.
Today, you are to research the topic, brainstorm and plan an approach you will be taking so that you can use a decision making process next week to determine your stance.
Your task:
Define the topic: Begin by clearly defining the topic you want to research and brainstorm. Make sure you have a good understanding of the issue and the different perspectives and opinions that are involved.
Conduct research: Research is a critical step in understanding a controversial topic. Look for information from a variety of sources, including academic journals, news articles, and online resources. Be sure to evaluate the credibility and reliability of your sources.
Identify key stakeholders: Controversial topics often involve multiple stakeholders, such as individuals, organizations, and governments. Identify who the key stakeholders are and what their perspectives are on the issue.
Analyze the pros and cons: Once you have gathered research and identified key stakeholders, it's important to analyze the pros and cons of different approaches. Identify the benefits and drawbacks of different solutions or actions, and consider how they might impact different stakeholders.
Brainstorm possible approaches: With a good understanding of the topic and the different perspectives involved, you can start to brainstorm possible approaches. Consider different solutions or actions that might address the issue in a constructive way. Try to think outside the box and consider innovative solutions.

You will be using the skills and knowledge learned today to choose an appropriate methodology for determining which solution you fill be focusing on. This is also an opportunity to outline the roles and responsibilities of each person in your group.
Using the template from Week 3, outline a plan for group member roles and responsibilities and the team requirements for success.
Evaluate potential outcomes: As you develop possible approaches, evaluate the potential outcomes of each. Consider the short-term and long-term effects on different stakeholders, and how the approach might impact the larger social, political, and economic context.
Create a SWOT or use another decision-making model to demonstrate the viability of your decision.

## Disruptive Technology Case Study Part 3
As part of your case study into a disruptive technology, it is time to define the project using a Project Statement. This statement will provide an overview of your position, the methodology used and the purpose of the final report you will be submitting.
Write a project statement for the disruptive case study that you have been working on the last several weeks. Make sure you include:
Project Objectives
Scope
Approach
Timeline
Budget
Assumptions and Risks
Remember this is an overview and should leave the details for later in the report.
