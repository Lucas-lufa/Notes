Scenario
You have just started working for a boutique Perth-based software development company. 
You will be working in a team that is creating a way to visualise messaging and encryption as a way of teaching young teenagers who are interested in coding. 
For this task, you do not have to worry about the visualisation part, as that will be handled by someone else in your team.
In this task, you will be using the requirements to create a simple model of the story provided below. The model includes Class Diagrams, Sequence and Communication Diagrams, and State and Activity Diagrams. You will write a little bit of Python as well to test your model and to learn about the relationship between the model and the code. 

Requirements
The story goes like this. 
Alice and Bob live in the same neighbourhood in a tiny town. They like to write each other old-fashioned letters. For example, when Alice writes a letter to Bob, she puts it in Bob’s letterbox, and vice versa. 
The letterbox has a little indicator (a flag) that shows whether it contains a letter.
Alice and Bob both check their letterboxes at most once a day and only one letter is in transit at any given moment. For example, after Alice sent a letter to Bob, she would not send another one until she’s had a response from Bob. 
A letter will mark itself as “read” whenever someone reads the message in the letter. This is a hidden state. Alice and Bob use this to check whether no one else has read their messages. 
Your task is to model this behaviour in UML diagrams. You can create the diagrams in one of the many online tools that exist. You may also use pen and paper and take a photo if that is easier. Make sure the diagrams are clearly readable. 
Step 8 requires you to write some Python code based on the models. If you want, you can write the Python code as you go along. This will help you to learn the relationship between the UML model and the code. Make sure to create a repository to put your code in (a requirement for Step 8).
