##    1. Unit Overview

        1.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)



        1.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)



        1.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points.
