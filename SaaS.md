## revision create web page

Using your knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 you are to create a simple two-page Résumé for a fictitious person.
You are allowed to use ChatGPT or similar AI to generate the CONTENT ONLY.
All code must be created by hand and must not use any frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, TailwindCSS, jQuery or similar.
The first page should contain the typical sections of a résumé including:

    Basic Personal Details (Your Name!)
    Resume Profile
    Resume Objective (optional)
    Resume Summary (optional)
    Experience
    Education
    Skills

The second page is to be a contact form (usually this is part of the resume, but we are intentionally moving to a separate page) and a map of the suburb the fictitious person lives in (using OpenMaps rather than a paid service).
For more details on a typical resume's content see:
