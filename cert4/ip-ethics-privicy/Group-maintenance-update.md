Individual groups members - in their own words - must offer a progress (maintenance) report and address the following questions:

    The effectiveness of the exchanges between group members

    There was in person meetings. Text chat and file exchange over teams. I think we did well there was a lot of discussion trying to figure out what we were meant to do, some discussion on how to do it and the doing was easy. 

    Are the individual roles and responsibilities been established yet?
        If so, what are they and what is yours?
        If not, why hasn't this been determined yet? (in your own words)

    We made roles and responsibility for each member but we didn't know what was important or how to act. We all really just did what ever was needed in the end. So I think in practicality we were all allrounders the only exceptions  MICHAEL CASTLE was the liaison emailing the lecturer, so not to overwhelm with questions and ALEXANDER MCKIE did the editing of videos, because it was a one person job. I think we all contributed well.

    What role would you most like to be delivering if you had the expertise? How would this help the work required to successfully deliver Assessment Task 2?

    I can't say any interest me although I liked contributing to the team in completing the task, I was afraid of letting the team down, I didn't expect liking helping the team complete the task as I did. From what I just said maybe the answer is allrounder.


    Highly theoretical and ethically-charged question here. This section relates to a concept known as 'Second-Order Viewing': Where you imagine a point in the future looking back to now and realising the opportunities in front of you now. OK?...
    You are being asked to reflect on your role in the group work, in particular, the influence you had on decisions and actions taken.
    Imagine yourself at the end of the semester looking back to this point in time: What do you think you would like to have changed if you had the chance? Speculate and elaborate on what opportunities you may have missed if you imagined yourself looking back to now.

    I am at the end of the semester looking back because I only realised that this task was here when I was making sure everything was completed.

    There are two things that stand out for me. One before doing the presentation it seem like a huge thing but after doing the preparing and then the presentation it was not such a big thing. I turned a step into a mountain. I also got a good feeling from working in a team to compete the task, which I didn't expect to get.
