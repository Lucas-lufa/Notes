### Quiz9: Data Privacy 2
A simple, albeit, extreme question:

From a societal perspective (i.e. public health, fighting crime, national security, defending peoples' rights, etc.)... is it better to have all information in the open to everyone, or to have all information concealed from everyone?
Selected Answers: 	

Maybe
Response Feedback: 	

LOL :-) 

There are no correct answers are there?  That is surely a possibility we sometimes face as ICT professionals, yes?

This question essentially takes an extreme view on whether we as a society could be heading toward a future where personal privacy no longer exists (helped by our own actions and behaviours online) and ultimately determined by politicians who are influenced by us and other factors (... we'll leave that there..), or whether at some point in the future our children's children will say "... enough is enough... NO MORE... leave me alone" and turn away from social media.

Take a look at this TEDx video from Mike Berry from University College London on his view on the future of Social Media.

"Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks to a person's privacy."
	

"The right to protect your reputation."

Response Feedback: 	

Incorrect.

Have another go.

CLUE: You need to choose TWO.

This is wrong 

"nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation." is not verbatim but it dose mean "The right to protect your reputation."

article 12 
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
