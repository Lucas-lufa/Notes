 S3: Ethical Dilemma - Self-Driving Cars Options Menu: Forum 	

Here, we are checking your level of awareness of ethics, morals and the challenge presented by self-driving cars.
Generally speaking, from what you have learned so far this week would you say self-driving cars are a good idea for society?
What are the pros and cons, and what can we do to mitigate the cons?
Please discuss.

automatic public transport not self driving cars.
self driving cars is the individualism next step but will leave anyone who doesn't have resources left without transport. A utilitarian solution would be automatic public transport. The night before set where you need to go and at what time, then tailor bus schedule is made maximising efficiency and making sure each is not overcrowded.

pros could be great efficiency, fast because traffic might be less and coordinated also flexible
cons data privacy, single point of failure
mitigation 
data: public oversight on how data is used and good data hygiene ie annotation and encryption at rest.
single point of failure: design a distributed, resistant self healing network (like the internet was designed)
