Students are required to research key institutions or organisations and locate authentic policies and procedures relating to the following subject areas:

    Intellectual Property
Intellectual property management
A guide for WA TAFE colleges
    https://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/uploads/ip-management-2019.pdf
    The domain is a government one. I searched for the department of training and workforce development found the site and was able to locate the pdf with a copyright search. 
    https://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/copyright-ip/copyright-and-intellectual-property

    Privacy
    https://www.northmetrotafe.wa.edu.au/privacy
    During orientation I was shown this section and I have independently found it in a web search.

    https://www.northmetrotafe.wa.edu.au/student-code-conduct  
    Ethical behavior management (e.g. Code of Conduct)
    During orientation I was shown this section, I have independently found it in a web search and there is a link to it in session three shell.

Students are asked to simply list each of these files AND explain why they think these represent authentic knowledge on behalf of the chosen organisation (i.e. explain why you think they are factual and not fake). Students must elaborate and go into detail (based on the guidance within the lecture.)
List each of these documents here, clearly displaying the name of the organisation and each subject area.

### S3: Ethical Dilemma - Self-Driving Cars Options Menu: Forum 	

Here, we are checking your level of awareness of ethics, morals and the challenge presented by self-driving cars.
Generally speaking, from what you have learned so far this week would you say self-driving cars are a good idea for society?
What are the pros and cons, and what can we do to mitigate the cons?
Please discuss.

automatic public transport not self driving cars.
self driving cars is the individualism next step but will leave anyone who doesn't have resources left without transport. A utilitarian solution would be automatic public transport. The night before set where you need to go and at what time, then tailor bus schedule is made maximising efficiency and making sure each is not overcrowded.

pros could be great efficiency, fast because traffic might be less and coordinated also flexible
cons data privacy, single point of failure
mitigation 
data: public oversight on how data is used and good data hygiene ie annotation and encryption at rest.
single point of failure: design a distributed, resistant self healing network (like the internet was designed)
