### Assignment draft
Being an ethical person or organisation means you are trust worthy. Trust in a society gives huge benefits wether they are worthy of it or not. Being ethical is an internal state that can not be seen only inferred from appearance. Appearance in an ethical context is done by stating what they are, the rules, laws, policy, procedures and accountability. 

what are the benefits
the importance of stating them

Trust gives a person or organisation a lot of benefits. There is less time spent on selling the merits of what is being done, it is assumed what ever is being done is for the good. If extra is being asked it probably for good reason. Debts will be paid, there is a willing ness to do work without money up front and loans are given. When something goes wrong no one is to concerned because what ever it is it will be rectified. Rules are enforced less strictly wether you are an individual or an organisation you are given more leay way. Trust is coveted for those worthy of it and even more for those that want to abuse it.  

Stating you beliefs
the importance of stating them
a common trick is to retro fit an ethical framework to an action this is to justify doing something bad. The tell tail signs to ethical frameworks being used as a cover is one doing something bad and justifying it raises my suspicions, not having integrity and changing the framework to suit.
the importance of getting the right amount of detail, to broad or to granular

Clearly stating ethics in policy and procedures is important mainly because it is what makes accountability work. When audits are done the actions preformed can be compared with stated ethics and see how they diverge. Writing giving guidance to both the reader and the writer. The reader uses as reference where when writing it promotes the writer to think deeply about it, not everyone will write the or contribute to the organisations policy and procedures but it is good to develop your personal ethics. A common trick is to retro fit an ethical framework to an action this is to justify doing something bad. The tell tail signs to ethical frameworks being used as a cover is one doing something bad and justifying it raises my suspicions, not having stated ethics or appropriate detail and changing the framework to suit. Detail in the policy and procedures is also important not enough and everything can be justified with it. Too much and anything but the very particular circumstance is permitted.

Accountability
actions is the only way the internal can be glimpsed.
when actions and stated ethic diverge.
scap goat

Ethics is am internal state and can only be glimpsed through action. Just as am idea is something internal and con only be seen indirectly through the action of describing it in speech or writing. Accountability is auditing the actions taken and comparing the to the standards set and then correcting things that make actions and standards diverge in negative ways. Just by being in place it will add trust and can repair trust when something goes wrong but can also be used to get trust when it is not earned. Common ways of abusing the systems are, saying the accountability is there but never do any auditing, doing the auditing but there is never any wrong doing found, finding wrong doing but not doing anything and finally finding wrong doing and using a scap goat.
  
This is how organisations best manage ethical behavior, stating values and having accountability. Why put all the effort into being perceived as ethical. How those who are not ethical use tricks to appear ethical why we need to vigilant and never take things at face value.

ASSESSABLE

Following on from our discussion in S4: Authentic Knowledge.

Using the matter from the SWOT Analysis class (or video or both), please CREATE A THREAD and elaborate in your own words (between 250 and 500 words) how an organisation can best manage ethical behaviour and how this can help its compliance with its IP and Privacy responsibilities. Students should also attempt to refer to the work carried out in the Week4 research activity by offering suggestions on areas of improvement that could be made in the organisations they researched upon.

Students must also respond to at least one other students discussion thread, in order to stimulate debate and progress the topic.

Tip: Remember to frame your answer as a SWOT theme (i.e. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. See https://www.wordstream.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/swot-analysis-header1.png

### four research
Students are required to research key institutions or organisations and locate authentic policies and procedures relating to the following subject areas:

    Intellectual Property
Intellectual property management
A guide for WA TAFE colleges
    https://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/uploads/ip-management-2019.pdf
    The domain is a government one. I searched for the department of training and workforce development found the site and was able to locate the pdf with a copyright search. 
    https://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/copyright-ip/copyright-and-intellectual-property

    Privacy
    https://www.northmetrotafe.wa.edu.au/privacy
    During orientation I was shown this section and I have independently found it in a web search.

    https://www.northmetrotafe.wa.edu.au/student-code-conduct  
    Ethical behavior management (e.g. Code of Conduct)
    During orientation I was shown this section, I have independently found it in a web search and there is a link to it in session three shell.

Students are asked to simply list each of these files AND explain why they think these represent authentic knowledge on behalf of the chosen organisation (i.e. explain why you think they are factual and not fake). Students must elaborate and go into detail (based on the guidance within the lecture.)
List each of these documents here, clearly displaying the name of the organisation and each subject area.

### S3: Ethical Dilemma - Self-Driving Cars Options Menu: Forum 	

Here, we are checking your level of awareness of ethics, morals and the challenge presented by self-driving cars.
Generally speaking, from what you have learned so far this week would you say self-driving cars are a good idea for society?
What are the pros and cons, and what can we do to mitigate the cons?
Please discuss.

automatic public transport not self driving cars.
self driving cars is the individualism next step but will leave anyone who doesn't have resources left without transport. A utilitarian solution would be automatic public transport. The night before set where you need to go and at what time, then tailor bus schedule is made maximising efficiency and making sure each is not overcrowded.

pros could be great efficiency, fast because traffic might be less and coordinated also flexible
cons data privacy, single point of failure
mitigation 
data: public oversight on how data is used and good data hygiene ie annotation and encryption at rest.
single point of failure: design a distributed, resistant self healing network (like the internet was designed)
