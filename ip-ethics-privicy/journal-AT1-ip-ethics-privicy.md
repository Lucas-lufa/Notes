##    1. Unit Overview

        1.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

session one power point.
 session one video.
 forum posts for other students


        1.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

over view of modules and over view of assessments AT1 the weekly and AT2 group presentation.

        1.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I understand what is expected in the weekly tasks and the assessments and their structure, forming groups, going thought the case study, 
  student-lecturer engagement,
##    2. Ethics 101

        2.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

session powerpoint and video
the students and staff code of conduct.

        2.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

That are ethics and values, alternative ethical behavior. how the person, organisation and environment effect ethics. Maintaining ethical standards. 

        2.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I always think ethics is what you outwardly overtly communicate, where values are what you actually believe, what they believe is shown by the actions that they take. Alternate ethical views are great to consider because it gives you different ideas that you can incorporate, I am defiantly an utilitarian. There are many thing that can effect how you behave, who you are, the people around you and the situation you are in. A good way to help maintain standards are code of conducts, they help remind and give you guide lines.  
##    3. Ethical Dilemma

        3.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT3VU4B5Dsc&t=130s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FypPSJfCRFk

        3.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

The videos in the shell "The Transplant Surgeon problem" and "BBC Report: The Problem with Driverless Cars" rases the questions you need to be asking your self. Is sacrificing one to save five ethical and in what circumstances? What things do you need to consider when with self driving cars.
In the shell there were other articles but they only abstracts, I couldn't read the full article, so not useful.

        3.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

When we are thinking what parameters we need to have in ethical and what is possible or relevant in the context of cars and road rules. When there is a conflict of one over another, a driver dose not have time to weigh all factors and is making snap decision, and can't be blamed for the out come unless the driver is impaired from alcohol or similar, gross negligence or malice. Where with artificial intelligent at the planning stage you can think thoroughly through all ethnical perperspetive for the best outcome. If this is transparent and chief exertive office is headed accountable than most likely the will have the best outcome for most people. Else opaque and a scapegoat held responsible the cars will favor the powerful. People have limited sensory and processing, AI cars how ever you can add more of each until a safe thresh hold is meet if not technically possible now could be in the future. Bugs in something that also needs to be addressed at the moment software company's are not liable for their products.  
##    4. Research Skills

        4.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

The week four powerpoint and the video explaining the power point. Read all the information on plagiarism and referencing it in the shell.
    https://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/uploads/ip-management-2019.pdf

    https://www.dtwd.wa.gov.au/copyright-ip/copyright-and-intellectual-property

    https://www.northmetrotafe.wa.edu.au/student-code-conduct  
    
        4.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

In this case there is really only one source because only the organisation publish their policy and procedures

        4.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

Integrity of information is important. If you look at the whole picture about the information, trying not to be biased, look at where the information is coming from, why are they saying what they are saying. Even bad information can be enlighten in certain ways.  
##    5. Communication

        5.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

https://business.gov.au/planning/business-plans/swot-analysis

the two old online workshops in the shell. The research done is session four.

        5.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

The task directly asked for these resources to be used.

        5.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

The chain of why do you want to be see to be ethical, shows that you can be trusted, why do you want trust, society grants benefits to the trust worth. How this sits on the three legged stool of stated beliefs, transparently and accountability. I was fun to explore. 
##    6. Intellectual Property

        6.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

The shell has a lot of text so started with that

        6.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

It is a very expansive topic. I have an interest in open source software. Based on the license something can be open or just have the appetence of being open.

        6.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I alway find it interesting if used for good allows people to earn a living from their intellectual work. But if used badly people will rent seek with it.
