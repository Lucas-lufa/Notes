##    1. Unit Overview

        1.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

session one power point.
 session one video.
 forum posts for other students


        1.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

over view of modules and over view of assessments AT1 the weekly and AT2 group presentation.

        1.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I understand what is expected in the weekly tasks and the assessments and their structure, forming groups, going thought the case study, 
  student-lecturer engagement,
##    2. Ethics 101

        2.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

session powerpoint and video
the students and staff code of conduct.

        2.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

That are ethics and values, alternative ethical behavior. how the person, organisation and environment effect ethics. Maintaining ethical standards. 

        2.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I always think ethics is what you outwardly overtly communicate, where values are what you actually believe, what they believe is shown by the actions that they take. Alternate ethical views are great to consider because it gives you different ideas that you can incorporate, I am defiantly an utilitarian. There are many thing that can effect how you behave, who you are, the people around you and the situation you are in. A good way to help maintain standards are code of conducts, they help remind and give you guide lines.  
##    3. Ethical Dilemma

        3.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NT3VU4B5Dsc&t=130s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FypPSJfCRFk

        3.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

The videos in the shell "The Transplant Surgeon problem" and "BBC Report: The Problem with Driverless Cars" rases the questions you need to be asking your self. Is sacrificing one to save five ethical and in what circumstances? What things do you need to consider when with self driving cars.
In the shell there were other articles but they only abstracts, I couldn't read the full article, so not useful.

        3.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

When we are thinking what parameters we need to have in ethical and what is possible or relevant in the context of cars and road rules. When there is a conflict of one over another, a driver dose not have time to weigh all factors and is making snap decision, and can't be blamed for the out come unless the driver is impaired from alcohol or similar, gross negligence or malice. Where with artificial intelligent at the planning stage you can think thoroughly through all ethnical perperspetive for the best outcome. If this is transparent and chief exertive office is headed accountable than most likely the will have the best outcome for most people. Else opaque and a scapegoat held responsible the cars will favor the powerful. People have limited sensory and processing, AI cars how ever you can add more of each until a safe thresh hold is meet if not technically possible now could be in the future. Bugs in something that also needs to be addressed at the moment software company's are not liable for their products.  
##    4. Research Skills

        4.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

The week four powerpoint and the video explaining the power point. Read all the information on plagiarism and referencing it in the shell.

        4.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

In this case there is really only one source because only the organisation publish their policy and procedures

        4.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

Integrity of information is important. If you look at the whole picture about the information, trying not to be biased, look at where the information is coming from, why are they saying what they are saying. Even bad information can be enlighten in certain ways.  
##    5. Communication

        5.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

https://business.gov.au/planning/business-plans/swot-analysis

the two old online workshops in the shell. The research done is session four.

        5.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

The task directly asked for these resources to be used.

        5.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

The chain of why do you want to be see to be ethical, shows that you can be trusted, why do you want trust, society grants benefits to the trust worth. How this sits on the three legged stool of stated beliefs, transparently and accountability. I was fun to explore. 
##    6. Intellectual Property

        6.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

The shell has a lot of text so started with that

        6.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

It is a very expansive topic. I have an interest in open source software. Based on the license something can be open or just have the appetence of being open.

        6.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I alway find it interesting if used for good allows people to earn a living from their intellectual work. But if used badly people will rent seek with it.

        7.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

Even though there is a lot of work been done in this area personal privacy is total our reponscablity so everyone is being prayed on by the powerful.

        7.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

we should be responsible personal privacy safety, or just like with personal safety we should be responsible but there is a force to back us up.

### Quiz9: Data Privacy 2

This is a got-ya question ,very frustration and no learning value.

A simple, albeit, extreme question:

From a societal perspective (i.e. public health, fighting crime, national security, defending peoples' rights, etc.)... is it better to have all information in the open to everyone, or to have all information concealed from everyone?
Selected Answers: 	

Maybe
Response Feedback: 	

LOL :-) 

There are no correct answers are there?  That is surely a possibility we sometimes face as ICT professionals, yes?

This question essentially takes an extreme view on whether we as a society could be heading toward a future where personal privacy no longer exists (helped by our own actions and behaviours online) and ultimately determined by politicians who are influenced by us and other factors (... we'll leave that there..), or whether at some point in the future our children's children will say "... enough is enough... NO MORE... leave me alone" and turn away from social media.

Take a look at this TEDx video from Mike Berry from University College London on his view on the future of Social Media.

CLUE: You need to think carefully about this answer.

This video give no insight to the question and it is not even interesting


Question 4
This question is just wrong 

Incorrect 	

Choose all options that align with your understanding of a "... distinct human right" as stated within Article 12 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (... which Australia was a founding member of by the way in 1948... 😉 )

TIP: Be careful... not as many as might first think.
Selected Answers: 	

"Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks to a person's privacy."
	

"The right to protect your reputation."
	

"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy, family, home or correspondence..."
Response Feedback: 	

Incorrect.

Have another go.

CLUE: You need to choose TWO.

This is just wrong 

"nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation." is not verbatim but it dose mean "The right to protect your reputation."

article 12 
No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

##    8. ICT Risk Management

        8.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

Shell content

 - Ethical behavior management
 - Leadership and risk
 - Compliance regarding ethics
 - ISO-38500

 watching the videos
 - Cyber security and risk management

        8.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

This one was overwhelming for me there seemed to be a lot more than others. 

        8.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

Being ethical in management, risk or security is a hallmark that these activities are done properly. This is because usually ethics is the last thing implemented  



##    9. Privacy, IP and Industry

        9.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

shell content

reading
 - ICT working to protect privacy
 - maintaining privacy and compliance
 - Privacy: Public, Private and the role of ICT professional
 - Practice: Privacy and the modern workplace
 - Blockchain and privacy
 - forth industrial revolution and privacy
 - privacy and big data 


        9.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

revisit cyber security and introduce more like the essential eight. Make privacy apart of the organisation. Think about tool that can be used in the workplace to improve compliance to privacy and why.

        9.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I don't think we have privacy done well yet. When there are data breaches the company's don't get repercussions even if they have keep unnessary information and not secured. And then there is surveillance capitalism.

##    10. Assessments AT2 Advice

        10.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

Shell power point and video about final assessment

        10.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

I took note

        10.3. Reflections

In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)


did this after I had done the final assessment


##    11. The purpose of reflection

        11.1. Evidence of research 
(E.g. which websites or academic journals did you visit?)

Shell power point and video on the purpose and technique of reflection

        11.2. Findings / Observations
(E.g. expand on why you referred to these sources as opposed to other sources you could have considered, and why you believe they apply or are relevant to the session topic under discussion.)

Took note

        11.3. Reflections
(E.g. Critically analyse the section or general topic under discussion. This is a chance for you to demonstrate your mastery of a topic by challenging (constructively) traditional methods or thinking around a particular area, and what ideas you may suggest to develop this area, or even continue the discussion by raising some interesting points. In this latter part I would urge students to use the discussion board.)

I think this should have been earlier. To say why we were doing reflection every week.

##    12. Assessment Task 2 – Group Video Presentation

        12.1. Your role
(Give details about your role, how it came about (e.g. did you nominate yourself for the role you carried out?)).

I got together the group, Analysed the case study and contributed to the groups understanding. We identified the talking points and completed my part and presented it.

        12.2. Your contribution to the group activities
(Explain why you believe you made a positive contribution.
Conversely, did anything go wrong? If so, what happened and how? (… remember here not to name names and to be professional and constructive. Just describe the facts and in the context of your own authority.)).

I made a positive contribution because I did my work and in a timely fashion and I presented it. I was very happy with my teams work. Nothing went wrong, it was stressful thinking about making a presentation but actually doing it was ok.

        12.3. Reflection: Would you have done anything differently?
(If you could go back in time and make new attempts at the group activities, what would they be?
If not, explain why you would not choose to return to a point in time you could have done better, managed a situation differently, etc.)

Do it earlier so it is out of the way.
