Ms Angelene Falk
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!
Question 2
	
Correct 	

The purpose of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner is... ?

Choose any that apply.
Selected Answers: 	

"Carrying out strategic information management functions within the Australian Government under the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act)"
	

"Making sure that Australian Government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, follow the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) and other laws when handling personal information."
	

"Protecting the public’s right of access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act)"
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Not all information is accessible from government agencies through an FOI request. E.g. Any information that reveals Australia's defensive strategies or operations, or information that is considered harmful to the national interest is generally considered undisclosable.
Question 3
	
Correct 	

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner is responsible for Information Privacy at a federal level.

Which role advocates on matters of Freedom of Information on behalf of Western Australians? Choose ONE option.
Selected Answer: 	

The Office of the Information Commissioner (WA)
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

You could get a firm of lawyers to represent you, of course. However, the OIC (WA) is an independent agency that advocates for all Western Australians on matters relating to government agencies and their obligations to release information as part of citizens' FOI rights.

There is also a link to the UN HC on Human Rights, as Australia is a signatory to that convention (was one of the founding members in fact...) relating to the rights of the individual. These in turn help dictate the 13 APPs used to form the basis of privacy legislation in this country. However, the WA OIC would be the first point of contact if a Western Australian had any issues re an FOI request to a government agency.
Question 4
	
Correct 	

TRUE or FALSE

The Privacy Act (Cth) 1988 can be amended anytime.
Selected Answer: 	

False
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Though Acts can be requested to be altered at any time, our elected members have a clear process to follow to create or amend any legislation. See https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/how-parliament-works/bills-and-laws/amendments/ for details on the formal legislation amendment process.
Question 5
	
Correct 	

Choose the odd one out from the selection that is NOT one of the 13 Australian Privacy Principals.
Selected Answer: 	

Quantity of personal information
Response Feedback: 	

Correct. Well done!

It's Quality, not the quantity of personal information - APP10 - that is one of the 13 APPs.
Question 6
	
Correct 	

How many Australians consider the protection of their personal data and information to be a major concern in their lives? Choose ONE option.
Selected Answer: 	

7 out of 10

Correct 	

What percentage of Australians were surveyed as being uncomfortable with businesses tracking their location whilst using their website or smart app?

Choose ONE option.
Selected Answer: 	

62%
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

In a 2020 survey on Australian community attitudes to privacy, 48% of those polled considered having their location tracked without their consent to represent the biggest risk to a person's privacy.
Question 8
	
Correct 	

Choose ONE option that best describes the purpose of data privacy and data security.
Selected Answer: 	

The balance an ICT professional must achieve in order to secure data from unauthorised access and permit authorised access of objects (e.g. systems, data, information) to occur safely and reliably.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Though the other options are plausible, they are not drivers to why we must ensure the organisation's data and systems are protected and remain available, whilst allowing access to data from those who need it to carry out their role effectively. 
Question 9
	
Correct 	

Why is it important to review an act, such as the Privacy Act 1988?

Choose all that apply.
Selected Answers: 	

Because links to other legislation become apparent as new impacts on society are experienced (e.g. COVID-19), thus the Privacy Act and its relationship to other Acts needs to move with the time.
	

Laws rarely remain unchanged anyway, so it's a part of a healthy debate to discuss how our privacy needs and expectations change as time goes on.
	

Because technology develops fast and government needs to be aware of the risks faced by its citizens at any time.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!
Question 10
	
Correct 	

Which piece of legislation does the Australian Privacy Principles support? Choose ONE.
Selected Answer: 	

The Privacy Act (Cth) 1988
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Don't forget, state and territory laws on privacy (or related topics) take priority over the federal Privacy Act where appropriate.

BTW... there is a Dog Act, City of Joondalup 1976 (see https://www.joondalup.wa.gov.au/files/councilmeetings/2007/Attach5brf131107.pdf )

NDAs can be used to protect ideas before you effectively manage this using a Patent. Especially useful if you have just created a service or product you think could have significant industrial application and wealth could be collected from it. See https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/ip-for-digital-business/idea/non-disclosure-agreements#:~:text=NDAs%20are%20private%20agreements%20between,for%20well%20over%20100%20years. for more information (IP Australia)

Question 6
	
Correct 	

Select the options that best explain the purpose and capability of Creative Commons.
Selected Answers: 	

"Enables authentic knowledge to be shared whilst balancing the rights of the creator with the need for public access."
	

"Creators still get a say in how their creations are shared using the appropriate CC Licence option available."
	

"... helps overcome legal obstacles to the sharing of knowledge and creativity to address the world’s pressing challenges."
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Creators who register their creations with Creative Commons (CC) can state exactly how they wish to see their knowledge shared by using one of the six licences available.Question 7
	
Correct 	

Select options that generally fall under the description of Academic Misconduct.
Selected Answers: 	

Unauthorised Collaboration - "Unauthorised Collaboration can also be called Collusion.  An example is when as assessment task is submitted for marking that was completed with another student but should have been completed individually.  This can include cross-group collusion.

BE AWARE this academic practice may differ from your home country if you are new to studying in Australia." 
	

Plagiarism - "Plagiarism is defined as presenting, “intentionally or unintentionally, the ideas or work of another person as one’s own ideas, or work without appropriate referencing or acknowledgement” (Edith Cowan University, 2019b, p.4). Plagiarism is the most common and well-known form of academic misconduct. " 
	

Examination Cheating - "Cheating in examinations goes beyond attempting to copy from another student.  Examples include:

    Providing or receiving assistance in an exam (including access to a mobile device).
    Completing an exam for another student.
    Outsourcing an exam to another student. " 

	

Contract Cheating - "Contract Cheating where an assessment task has been outsourced to a third party.  This can be paid or unpaid and is one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct." 
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Group Work is fine to do, and students should share their learning experiences together and enjoy their time here at NM TAFE. But when these shared ideas manifest into words on the page and all your student friends are writing the same content for the assignment (for example), this is a clear case of Unauthorised Collusion. 

Academic Misconduct harms the student, the educational institution that awarded the student with their qualification, society, the economy... from top to bottom is a corrosive phenomenon that ultimately does no good at all.

Acknowledge given to Edith Cowan University (2019) for definitions supplied to Plagiarism, Unauthorised Collaboration, Contract Cheating and Examination Cheating.

Correct 	

Pick the year the Copyright Act was last updated by parliament.
Selected Answer:

Question 1
	
Correct 	

Choose several options that best describe Patents and/or their purpose.
Selected Answers: 	

Protect inventions if they are

    New
    Inventive
    Have industrial applications

	

Patent protection lasts for 20 years.
	

If you have an idea that has clear potential for industrial applications...

    Tell nobody (revealing your idea could give your competitors an advantage before you patent it yourself)
    Hire a patent lawyer as this is a very litigious process and can take many years to complete.

Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Patents protect your creation from the ideas stage to the ultimate manifestation into a product or service that has clear industrial or commercial application.
Question 2
	
Correct 	

Choose several options that best describes Design Rights.
Selected Answers: 	

Protection is automatic (like copyright) if unregistered.
	

Protection lasts for 3 years if left unregistered.
	

Protect what things look like, their shape or appearance.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Design Rights only last 3 years (if unregistered) in order to encourage inventors or companies to constantly innovate and improve products already in the market. Protection for this amount of time is without formal registration with the Australian Patent Office.

If this automatic unregistered protection lasts too long, it would most likely prevent companies from wanting to develop their ideas into products for fear of protection. This is why design rights are for a short time only.
Question 3
	
Correct 	

How many years does copyright protect a creation? Choose ONE answer from below.
Selected Answer: 	

70 years after the death of the person who created the product in question. This creation can not be performed, used, shown or rented without permission.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Copyright is the right of the creator to their creation, and 70 years after their death (even if identified posthumously) is the length of time creations are protected.
Question 4
	
Correct 	

TRUE or FALSE:

Registering a product with the Australian Patent Office (IP Australia) gives protection for 20 years.
Selected Answer: 	

True
Response Feedback: 	

Correct.

20 years is the total time a product can be protected by patent law.

q3 Choose ONE answer you think is correct. There is only ONE correct answer.
A question that contains an absolute outcome is either Yes or No, 1 or 0, monochrome, etc.
From an absolute perspective, can we draw meaning by discovering something is false?
		
No, because knowing what is false is not a search for truth. We can only learn about the world by discovering what is true in life.
		
No. We search for truth and that means only truisms are meaningful.
		
* Yes. By discovering something as false, then we know that something is not true. Therefore, we can draw meaning from this and add to our wisdom.
