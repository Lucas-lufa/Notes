A question that contains an absolute outcome is either Yes or No, 1 or 0, monochrome, etc.
From an absolute perspective, can we draw meaning by discovering something is false?
		
No, because knowing what is false is not a search for truth. We can only learn about the world by discovering what is true in life.
