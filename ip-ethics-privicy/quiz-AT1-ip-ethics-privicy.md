Fill in the missing words.
"Reflection is not necessarily a ________ or sequential log of what took place."
Correct, well done!
Reflection is the analysis of the journal or sequence of events that took place. Many people seem to understand the journal
is the reflection, but not true 😉
Question 2
Selected Answers:
Response Feedback:
Generally speaking, why could it be said that handwritten notes are a more effective memory aid than typed notes?
Choose ANY options that apply.
A personalised experience: Because only you string words together in the way that you do.
Because they were written by you, they contain more tacit metadata than notes did not write (i.e. typed, e.g. in a book.)
When writing our notes, using different colours has been known to aid the memory recall process.

Selected Answer: 	
non-compliance
Response Feedback: 	

Correct. Well done!
Question 2
	
Correct 	

Choose all options that satisfy your belief why ethical behaviour and risk management are considered linked in the context of the ICT professional.
Selected Answers: 	

The actions taken to manage all ICT risks have beneficial effects on many levels and impact all employees within the organisation. 
	

Because understanding risks as an ICT professional puts you in a position both many people would understand. Therefore, it is considered a professional obligation to identify, assess and mitigate/eliminate all ICT risks where practically achievable to do so.
	

Because to protect the organisation's systems and data infrastructure is the responsibility of the ICT professional.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.
Question 3
	
Correct 	

Please choose ONE option that best describes the main purpose of Risk Management within the contemporary organisation.
Selected Answer: 	

Because we value the safety and well-being of our people. within our organisation.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Though we say that the purpose of Risk Management is perhaps to identification, assessment (including the rating) and mitigation/elimination of risks to an organisation's systems and data, the overall main purpose is to protect the organisation (including its people). 
Question 4
	
Correct 	

TRUE or FALSE:

From an organisational perspective, it is the role of LEADERSHIP to ensure an organisation's staff, contractors and visitors are safe whilst in the workplace.
Selected Answer: 	

True
Response Feedback: 	

A nice easy one :-)

The term 'Leadership' is the key here, as anyone within the organisation can exhibit leadership by their decisions and actions (as in drawing inspiration from these actions and behaviours), and is not just defined by those who run the organisation.

Take a look at this video taken from a CFO conference explaining the role of leadership and risk management. You don't have to play it all, but it quickly gives you insight into why high-level executives perceive leadership as not just roles at their level but occurs throughout the organisation.

Question 5
	
Correct 	

Choose ONE option that best describes how an organisation should approach and deliver ICT risk assessment most effectively.
Selected Answer: 	

As an approach to ICT risk assessment, the project manager, or appropriate role within an organisation's management structure must

    Identify criteria,
    Gather all facts,
    Carry out a discovery phase,
    Communicate and consult with impacted parties (stakeholders) and
    Constantly review during delivery.

Response Feedback: 	

Correct. Well done!

Only through processes of planned actions (in advance) and richly communicated before, during and after is our best approach for effective ICT risk assessment in an organisation.

Also, the best time to risk assessment is during the organisation's 'Business As Usual' (BAU) processes. Else any risk assessment will not be considered realistic.
Question 6
	
Correct 	

Choose the ONE option that best explains why we need to record near-miss events.
Selected Answer: 	

A near miss is an opportunity to resolve a hazardous event from happening again.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Near Misses could be said to be a lucky event that could have easily have resulted in some loss or injury, so we do not want them happening again for precisely this reason.

## q9

Question 1
	
Correct 	

According to the Daily Telegraph (2018), how many data points did Facebook use about each of its users?

Choose ONE option.
Selected Answer: 	

About 100
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Data points are distinct items of information that describe you and your behaviour whilst using a platform. E.g. Gender, age, sexual Orientation, purchases, tastes in music, news provider preference, political affiliations.. and much more. All these can be garnered by Facebook or another social media platform based on your choices.

Facebook wouldn't just rely on your choices when using their platform, as they have partnerships with many data capture organisations (or 'Data Brokers' - remember Cambridge Analytica?), all designed to (a) advertise to you, (b) persuade you to vote for a certain candidate, (c) dislike a particular product or organisation,... etc etc.

These days, a person can be described by up to 1500 data points, all distinct to you and highly marketable. See the video below on just how data analytics can be used to target information at you in order to influence your decisions.

Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Ours and other governments monitor what their citizens do online, including their communications, in the name of national security. This is where our rights to privacy as humans hits the threshold into another arena where people are harmed purely because the information within a liberal democracy is available. The cost of freedom? Very debatable.

Question 3
	
Correct 	

A simple, albeit, extreme question:

From a societal perspective (i.e. public health, fighting crime, national security, defending peoples' rights, etc.)... is it better to have all information in the open to everyone, or to have all information concealed from everyone?
Selected Answers: 	

Yes
	

Maybe
	

Don't know
	

No
Response Feedback: 	

LOL :-) 

There are no correct answers are there? That is surely a possibility we sometimes face as ICT professionals, yes?

This question essentially takes an extreme view on whether we as a society could be heading toward a future where personal privacy no longer exists (helped by our own actions and behaviours online) and ultimately determined by politicians who are influenced by us and other factors (... we'll leave that there..), or whether at some point in the future our children's children will say "... enough is enough... NO MORE... leave me alone" and turn away from social media.

Question 4
	
Correct 	

Choose all options that align with your understanding of a "... distinct human right" as stated within Article 12 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (... which Australia was a founding member of by the way in 1948... 😉 )

TIP: Be careful... not as many as might first think.
Selected Answers: 	

"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with their privacy, family, home or correspondence..."
	

"Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks to a person's privacy."
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Article 12 deals with the rights of a human in the context of privacy. Whilst some of the other options relating to a person's rights may be contained within other UN declarations, these two only refer to Article 12.

See https://www.un.org/en/udhrbook/pdf/udhr_booklet_en_web.pdf for an easy-to-read version of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
Question 5
	
Correct 	

From a legal perspective, privacy can be restricted for certain reasons depending on the laws of a country. In Australia, when is it deemed acceptable to violate a person's right to privacy?

Choose all that apply.
Selected Answers: 	

To protect national security
	

To protect public safety
	

In the public interest, e.g. to hold public figures (e.g. elected members of parliament) to account
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Whilst we have the right to privacy, this does not extend into investigating who may be attempting to violate your privacy. In doing so, you may be violating someone else's privacy. Two wrongs don't make a right..!
Question 6
	
Correct 	

The preservation of one's own privacy is often offset against other wants and needs, such as convenience. Convenience can come in many forms, such as ease of access, shallow learning curves and of course, mobility: The ability to access personal, confidential data within a secure system.

Choose ONE option that best answers the following question:

What is the purpose of Multi-Factor Authentication?
Selected Answer: 	

Where your personal email or mobile phone number is regarded as a primary form of identity. If you can access either using a device you own (i.e. mobile phone), it must be you.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

MFA, though not perfect, does rely on the fact that you and only you can receive an authentic code issued at a specific time and requiring you to respond in a given timeframe. These requirements are slack though demanding enough to satisfy the organisation you are attempting to gain access to, e.g. your bank, student login at NM TAFE, etc.

It does also bring into question the notion that our mobile phones have now become a part of our IDENTITY. Given the hacks possible to a mobile phone, how reasonable is this assumption?

Question 7
	
Correct 	

Many organisations employ a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) regime when issuing devices to their workforce. Whilst this offers many benefits in terms of asset reduction (costs, maintenance, etc.), there are also drawbacks i nterms of confidential and protection of data.

Choose all options that apply that represent potential risks to the organisation in the context of data protection.
Selected Answers: 	

Weak passwords being permissible on a personal device when beyond the full reach of the organisation's data protection policies.
	

The potential for confidential data being stored on a worker's device, thus beyond the full reach of the organisation's data protection policies.
	

Crucial system access data (e.g. passwords, keystrokes data, etc.) being stored on a personal device, then potential being accessible when the device leaves the trusted network 
	

The device being infected with malicious software as a result of being beyond the full reach of the organisation's data protection policies.
	

The risk of a device being left on a train containing potentially confidential information.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

The benefits and risks related to BYOD usually balance each other. One is mobility, another is the convenience of using own device: each represents risks to the organisation's systems and data protection.

"Carrying out strategic information management functions within the Australian Government under the Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010 (AIC Act)"
	

"Making sure that Australian Government agencies and organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million, and some other organisations, follow the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) and other laws when handling personal information."
	

"Protecting the public’s right of access to documents under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act)"
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Not all information is accessible from government agencies through an FOI request. E.g. Any information that reveals Australia's defensive strategies or operations, or information that is considered harmful to the national interest is generally considered undisclosable.
Question 3
	
Correct 	

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner is responsible for Information Privacy at a federal level.

Which role advocates on matters of Freedom of Information on behalf of Western Australians? Choose ONE option.
Selected Answer: 	

The Office of the Information Commissioner (WA)
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

You could get a firm of lawyers to represent you, of course. However, the OIC (WA) is an independent agency that advocates for all Western Australians on matters relating to government agencies and their obligations to release information as part of citizens' FOI rights.

There is also a link to the UN HC on Human Rights, as Australia is a signatory to that convention (was one of the founding members in fact...) relating to the rights of the individual. These in turn help dictate the 13 APPs used to form the basis of privacy legislation in this country. However, the WA OIC would be the first point of contact if a Western Australian had any issues re an FOI request to a government agency.
Question 4
	
Correct 	

TRUE or FALSE

The Privacy Act (Cth) 1988 can be amended anytime.
Selected Answer: 	

False
Response Feedback:

62%
Response Feedback:

In a 2020 survey on Australian community attitudes to privacy, 48% of those polled considered having their location tracked without their consent to represent the biggest risk to a person's privacy.
Question 8

Choose ONE option that best describes the purpose of data privacy and data security.
Selected Answer: 	

The balance an ICT professional must achieve in order to secure data from unauthorised access and permit authorised access of objects (e.g. systems, data, information) to occur safely and reliably.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Though the other options are plausible, they are not drivers to why we must ensure the organisation's data and systems are protected and remain available, whilst allowing access to data from those who need it to carry out their role effectively. 
Question 9
	
Correct 	

Why is it important to review an act, such as the Privacy Act 1988?

Choose all that apply.
Selected Answers: 	

Because links to other legislation become apparent as new impacts on society are experienced (e.g. COVID-19), thus the Privacy Act and its relationship to other Acts needs to move with the time.
	

Laws rarely remain unchanged anyway, so it's a part of a healthy debate to discuss how our privacy needs and expectations change as time goes on.
	

Because technology develops fast and government needs to be aware of the risks faced by its citizens at any time.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!
Question 10
	
Correct 	

Which piece of legislation does the Australian Privacy Principles support? Choose ONE.
Selected Answer:

Correct 	

Select options that generally fall under the description of Academic Misconduct.
Selected Answers: 	

Unauthorised Collaboration - "Unauthorised Collaboration can also be called Collusion.  An example is when as assessment task is submitted for marking that was completed with another student but should have been completed individually.  This can include cross-group collusion.

BE AWARE this academic practice may differ from your home country if you are new to studying in Australia." 
	

Plagiarism - "Plagiarism is defined as presenting, “intentionally or unintentionally, the ideas or work of another person as one’s own ideas, or work without appropriate referencing or acknowledgement” (Edith Cowan University, 2019b, p.4). Plagiarism is the most common and well-known form of academic misconduct. " 
	

Examination Cheating - "Cheating in examinations goes beyond attempting to copy from another student.  Examples include:

    Providing or receiving assistance in an exam (including access to a mobile device).
    Completing an exam for another student.
    Outsourcing an exam to another student. " 

	

Contract Cheating - "Contract Cheating where an assessment task has been outsourced to a third party.  This can be paid or unpaid and is one of the most serious forms of academic misconduct." 
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done.

Group Work is fine to do, and students should share their learning experiences together and enjoy their time here at NM TAFE. But when these shared ideas manifest into words on the page and all your student friends are writing the same content for the assignment (for example), this is a clear case of Unauthorised Collusion. 

Academic Misconduct harms the student, the educational institution that awarded the student with their qualification, society, the economy... from top to bottom is a corrosive phenomenon that ultimately does no good at all.

Acknowledge given to Edith Cowan University (2019) for definitions supplied to Plagiarism, Unauthorised Collaboration, Contract Cheating and Examination Cheating.

Patent protection lasts for 20 years.
	

If you have an idea that has clear potential for industrial applications...

    Tell nobody (revealing your idea could give your competitors an advantage before you patent it yourself)
    Hire a patent lawyer as this is a very litigious process and can take many years to complete.

Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Patents protect your creation from the ideas stage to the ultimate manifestation into a product or service that has clear industrial or commercial application.
Question 2
	
Correct 	

Choose several options that best describes Design Rights.
Selected Answers: 	

Protection is automatic (like copyright) if unregistered.
	

Protection lasts for 3 years if left unregistered.
	

Protect what things look like, their shape or appearance.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Design Rights only last 3 years (if unregistered) in order to encourage inventors or companies to constantly innovate and improve products already in the market. Protection for this amount of time is without formal registration with the Australian Patent Office.

If this automatic unregistered protection lasts too long, it would most likely prevent companies from wanting to develop their ideas into products for fear of protection. This is why design rights are for a short time only.
Question 3
	
Correct 	

How many years does copyright protect a creation? Choose ONE answer from below.
Selected Answer: 	

70 years after the death of the person who created the product in question. This creation can not be performed, used, shown or rented without permission.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Copyright is the right of the creator to their creation, and 70 years after their death (even if identified posthumously) is the length of time creations are protected.
Question 4
	
Correct 	

TRUE or FALSE:

Registering a product with the Australian Patent Office (IP Australia) gives protection for 20 years.
Selected Answer: 	

True
Response Feedback: 	

Correct.

20 years is the total time a product can be protected by patent law.

A question that contains an absolute outcome is either Yes or No, 1 or 0, monochrome, etc.
From an absolute perspective, can we draw meaning by discovering something is false?
		
No, because knowing what is false is not a search for truth. We can only learn about the world by discovering what is true in life.
