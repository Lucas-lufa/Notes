### q4
Question 1
	
Correct 	

TRUE or FALSE:

Validity means the research results are measurable and that these measures represent the facts (truth) of the research.
Selected Answer: 	

True
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!
Question 2
	
Correct 	

As responsible, professional technologists, how best should we view content from Wikipedia when conducting research?

Choose ONE option.
Selected Answer: 	

View Wikipedia as a good place to start, but never use any content from the body of the main page as fact within a formal submission unless it has been verified by several credible sources.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Wikipedia would be a good place to start by using the 'References' section (at the bottom of the page) and identifying some of the non-commercial (e.g. .org) and academic (.edu or from an academic database, e.g. ProQuest) sources.

Even better to use Google Scholar or an industry-leading website (e.g. HBR.org).
Question 3
	
Correct 	

Choose ONE option that is a good test for factual knowledge (truth).

"Something is considered factual if..."
Selected Answer: 	

".. it is provable (we can show evidence of the same outcome from multiple credible sources)"
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

This was a tricky one. The reference to sensory acceptance appeals to the Kantian statement "... seeing is believing.", which Kant used to emphasise that objects may not always be accepted as fact just because we can see it (for example.)

The reference to accepting facts from authoritative sources is another debatable (and doubtable) statement given the era of 'fake news' we now find ourselves in.
Question 4
	
Correct 	

"If our research question is unsophisticated, then ..." (choose ONE option below)
Selected Answer: 	

".. we can expect our results to be unsophisticated."
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

This question reminds us that the results of our research are linked directly to the question(s) we ask and where we accept the answer from.

Not only should the research question and methodology be appropriate to the spirit of the research (i.e. why we are conducting research), we should also be thinking about the source we goto and/or accept the results from. Sources should be credible (e.g. offer the view from an industry leader), or is peer-reviewed.
Question 5
	
Correct 	

Knowledge that is peer-reviewed means... (choose ONE option)
Selected Answer: 	

...has been verified by independent experts as factual (e.g. results can be reproduced based on the description of the research methodology.)
Response Feedback: 	

Correct. Well done!

A research article that is 'peer-reviewed' means the methodology and subsequent results have been independently verified and supported as factual by recognised academics within the relevant field.
Question 6
	
Incorrect 	

APA (American Psychological Association) v6/7 is a referencing style. It is designed to... (choose ANY that apply)
Selected Answers: 	

To credit other academics' or authors' works in a consistent format appropriate to the field of study (e.g. Science).
Response Feedback: 	

Incorrect. Have another go.
Question 7
	
Correct 	

Choose from ONE of the options that represent the proper format for APA referencing style to the end-text reference below:

Goldberg, R. (2002). Taking sides: Clashing views on controversial issues in drugs and society. McGraw-Hill/Dushkin.
Selected Answer: 	

(Goldberg, 2002, p. 148).
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

See https://guides.dtwd.wa.gov.au/nmtafe-apa for more details on the APA referencing format preferred by NM TAFE.
Question 8
	
Correct 	

Relating to Assessment Task 2, why is it important to list your roles on your Bb Group page? (Choose ONE from below)
Selected Answer: 	

AT2 requires EQUAL contribution to the final presentation, hence roles need to be established and declared NOW and within the presentation itself.
Response Feedback: 	

Correct, well done!

Roles are necessary to establish and display so the lecturer can easily determine each group member's contribution. Without this, the lecturer will need additional evidence of contribution in order to grade each member's contribution as satisfactory.
Assessment task four
It’s a research activity – Privacy and IP Policies or supporting documents
To locate and list some authentic policies and procedures from well-known organisations or institutions (do not critique them, just prove they are authentic and represent the institution or organisation you are interested in.)

A question that contains an absolute outcome is either Yes or No, 1 or 0, monochrome, etc.
From an absolute perspective, can we draw meaning by discovering something is false?
		
No, because knowing what is false is not a search for truth. We can only learn about the world by discovering what is true in life.
		
No. We search for truth and that means only truisms are meaningful.
		
* Yes. By discovering something as false, then we know that something is not true. Therefore, we can draw meaning from this and add to our wisdom.
		
Yes, but if all we do is find falses in life then how can this be progressive, right?
