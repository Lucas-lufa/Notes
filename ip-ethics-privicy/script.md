hi my name is Lucas
Group project update for NoName group

Overall Project Status
We have a clear understanding of the work that needs to be done
and the documents that need to be created. 
We are currently exploring how to handle the audio-visual sections.

Work completed in past week
We held a meeting and formulated a plan.
Our team also conducted research activities.
Alex: Completed the video template.
Clive: Finished a personal case study review.
Lucas: Finished a personal case study review.
Michael: Completed work on the case study and
ensured efficient task completion by members.
Nathan: Completed the template document for 
the group to contribute to for the final presentation.

Work to complete in next 7 days
Our upcoming tasks involve understanding the audio-visual aspects,
gathering tools, techniques, and styles suitable for the presentation, 
and holding a meeting to make selections.

Group members will collaborate to merge the information gathered
into a draft document that can be used to extract content for our final presentation.

What is going well?
The group is taking the initiative to find times when
we are all available to plan and work on this unit.
We are all working hard, and each of us offers our unique skill sets
and views on tackling issues that we face.

What is NOT going well?
Finding times when we can all physically work on this together is challenging.

Outstanding risks and issues
The risk of conflicting schedules with other significant projects
and potential slow progress as deadlines approach.

Any other comments none
