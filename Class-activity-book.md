ICTICT532 - Apply IP, ethics and privacy in ICT environments 

Question 1: What are the rights of copyright ownership?

Gives the owners of the copyright, not necessarily the creator, certain exclusive rights to the creation. These right can be used to exploit the creation commercially. It allows the copyright holder to control how the material, product or content is being used. This control lets the copyright holder set terms of use which may or may not include payment. There is fair use which don’t need authorisation or payment such as individual study or analysis, critique, review, parody, satire, news reporting,  private time-shifting, format-shifting and space-shifting. Other uses do not require authorisation but do require fair payment are statutory education licence and statutory government license controlled by the copyright agency.


Question 2: What are the benefits of having organisational policies and procedures?

It is about being prepared. Identifying categories that need to be addressed when they come up, the policies need to be general enough that it covers all the things that apply but not so general that it covers everything. Then what to do when something comes up, these instructions need  to tell what to do but not be so prescriptive that stops flexibility to adapt to the circumstance. The advantage of this is you are keeping experience on what is important to deal with and how to deal with it so people who have dealt with it can leverage the organisations experience. Even if something happens that hasn’t happened to the organisation before if it has been thought about won’t be totally on the backfoot.


Question 3: What are the organisational requirements for ensuring system security?
Ensuring that only authorised personnel have access to the information.
Keep up with escalating threats and risks.






















Question 4:  What are the important factors to be considered while designing a code of ethics?
The social norms of the society the organisation is operating in, they don't need to be better but cannot lower. This is even more important than complying with the law because if the law is ahead of the social norms the society just won't enforce it.

Reputation,the organisation's goals, the effect of the organisation externally and internally, reviews build in. Reputation is tricky because going after it can lead to being unethical, ideally it happens as a side effect of behaving well. The organisation's goals or propose is hard because being profitable is a main indicator that an organisation is successful and thus delivering on it propose but when the measure becomes the only thing, things go bad. While preforming the activities to achieve it's goals other effects happen to the wider society for good or bad. If these are not dealt with, either from not recognising or ignoring, it is unethical. Just as the effect on the wider society so is the effects on it's employees or internally. Review is important for two reasons, to make sure at least you are not lagging behind society and to see if the organisation is actually ethical.


Question 5: Why is the consultation of staff and stakeholders important when creating a code of ethics? What questions may you ask to get the information needed?
It is important to consult with staff and stakeholders for creating the code of ethics because they are part of the wider society they are operating in, maybe not so much with international organisations, and will know what is appropriate. The bigger your sample the more likely get a true reparation. Questions to ask are the organisation's goals, the effect of the organisation externally and internally.
