# group - Deep learning
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning

- part of a broader family of machine learning methods.
- based on artificial neural networks
- deep refers to multiple layers through the data is transformed. Methods to transform can be either supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised.

## significant attributes
### multiple layers. First is simplest, each builds on top of the last.
- Deep neural network is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between input and outputs
- The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than similarly performing shallow network.
- Can model complex non-linear relationships.

- Artificial neutral networks (ANN) tend to be static and symbolic.

DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or "weights", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.[140] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.
