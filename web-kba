UML is generally not used for documenting a website. UML's formal use in web development is limited.
It may be used to assist in the documentation of a web application or similar, but from the standpoint of this unit, we would not use UML.

Some components of UML, such as the sequence, interaction overview, and communication diagrams have been interpreted and now form the likes of User Experience Flows and other techniques.

Likewise, we tend not to use our initial sketches as formal documentation.

Also, if you regard HTML, CSS, and JS as "programming languages" we may use comments in our code to make it easier to find sections or to visually separate them when coding.

There is debate on 'dark mode' being an accessibility feature that can be turned on in a web browser. This is especially true with operating systems often adding this feature as part of their work.

When it comes to pure accessibility the removal of images, caching of the web pages and javascript all hinder the use of a web page for someone with a disability.
