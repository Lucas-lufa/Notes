# Session One
 Exercise - Requirements, documents and planning
Break up into groups (if possible) and create a document that identifies the requirements and instructions on how to bake a cake.
Scenario:
You are a head pastry chef at a 2* restaurant in perth. Your area manager (lecturer) has asked you to prepare an outline document so that all locations in WA and maybe further can re-create one of our delicious cakes. Your task is to complete this document and submit it to your manager by the end of the day.
Considerations:

    Identify the cake to be documented. (If online, you may select your choice of cake)
    What must be included?
    What are the requirements?
    What do they need to know?
    How will you convey this information to other chefs?


Limitations - This is simply an exercise in identifying requirements and documenting them. Don't worry too much about headings or exact structure of the document.
